- Kyle's implementation defaults the date picker button to the current date the first time the page is loaded, which is much smarter than mine. I didn't think of doing that because his example of a "working" project at the beginning of the video still used the hard-coded date when loaded, but it is a good idea and makes sense for something that will be used in a real-world application.
- Kyle's implementation dynamically populates the date picker when it is opened for the first time instead of using the hard-coded data, which is also much smarter than mine. This drastically reduces the size of index.html and shows the process of taking a mockup and converting it to working code. (Also, it's a great idea, because then our initial date can be whatever we want it to be, although the current date makes the most sense.)
- I solved the problem well, but Kyle's solution was much cleaner and smaller. Some of it was because he had the advantage of knowing the date-fns library better than me, but I saw all of the functions he ended up using while I was looking through the documentation, so if I had been thinking a bit more critically and paying attention to the documentation a bit better, I could have probably come up with a similar solution to his.
- Overall, I like Kyle's solution better than mine, but I enjoyed solving and thinking through this problem, and I learned how to take a mockup and turn it into a fully functional application along the way. 10/10 project, it was a great way to review and solidify a lot of the materials I've learned.

After redoing the project in TypeScript, here are my thoughts:
- I agree with my thoughts from when I originally did this project. It is a great project for taking a mockup and turning it into something functional.
- I don't think I read through this list before I started the TypeScript version of the project, but I ended up making the TS version default to the current date and dynamically populate the date picker when it is opened. I still left the hardcoded data in as a fallback (in case the JavaScript isn't fully loaded), but if I were to do this project again, I would probably make some kind of loading state with an animation to indicate it is working.
- My better familiarity with the date-fns library allowed me to solve a lot of the date manipulation problems much more cleanly this time, although hopefully the Temporal API will eliminate or reduce the need for familiarity with libraries when it is fully implemented. Until then, I think date-fns is probably the cleanest solution I've seen for working with dates in JavaScript.
