# Advanced Course

A quick note on the advanced course. I took a long break from the course after completing the first 5 sections, and when I came back, I decided to redo the sections I had already completed to give myself a refresher, but with a couple of changes.

First, I did not enjoy using Parcel as my bundler, so the second time around, I decided to use Vite wherever a bundler was used. I've wanted to learn Vite for a while, but wasn't sure how to get started, so this gave me an opportunity to commit to learning it while I refresh myself on the lessons of the first part of the advanced course.

Second, I have wanted to start learning how to use Typescript, and from what I've seen on the internet, it seems like a good way to get started is to take Javascript that I wrote and understand and rewrite it in Typescript using an editor like VS Code to help show me the differences between Javascript and Typescript, so I also decided to do that the second time around. Of course, this won't tell me everything there is to know about Typescript, so I'll still have to go out of my way to learn some things, but it will give me a good starting point to allow me to make my code better overall.

Based on the above, the file structure of the advanced course will have two differences from the file structure of the beginner course:

1. The directory for each course section will have an additional directory within it called "Typescript Solutions". This additional directory will have the Typescript solutions for each of the activities from the different lessons contained in that section of the course.
2. Each project within a section will have two solutions: one that is done using Javascript, and one that is done using Typescript.

Aside from that, the file structure of the advanced course will be the same as that of the beginner course.
