# javascript-simplified

The home for all my code for the JavaScript Simplified course (found [here](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com)). The course is broken into small videos that cover various JavaScript topics, many of which are accompanied by activities and projects that reinforce the topics covered. Below is a list of links to each of the projects that I completed for this class.

-   [Build a working modal](/Section%206%20-%20Basic%20DOM/44-and-45-modal-project/) (lessons 44 and 45 in the Basic DOM section (Section 6))
-   [Build a Quiz App](/Section%207%20-%20Control%20Flow/54-and-55-quiz-app-project/) (lessons 54 and 55 in the Control Flow section (Section 7))
