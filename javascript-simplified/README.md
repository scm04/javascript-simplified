# JavaScript Simplified

My code for the [JavaScript Simplified course](https://javascriptsimplified.com/). This course is made up of two smaller courses, [the beginner course](/javascript-simplified/beginner-course/) and [the advanced course](/javascript-simplified/advanced-course/), with an additional group of bonus projects to do at the end of each course.

Each section is made up of videos that cover various JavaScript topics, many of which are accompanied by activities and projects that reinforce the topics covered. To see the projects for a course, look through the README provided for that course.
