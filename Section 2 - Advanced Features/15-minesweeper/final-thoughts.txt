Kyle and I took fundamentally different approaches to this project, but I don't really think one approach was better than the other. I think if I were to do this project again, I would probably separate my game logic from my UI logic like he did (that separation of concerns makes a bit more sense to me than putting everything together like I did), but aside from that, I think the only other thing I would change about my approach is the logic for revealing tiles. His logic was much simpler than mine and much easier to read. I enjoyed this project a lot, though, and it helped me see how far I've come since starting this class, as a lot of the things I did in this project are things I wouldn't have been able to do before this class.
